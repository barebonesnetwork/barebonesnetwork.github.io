    About Us

  <p>
    Our goal is to try to archive our creations and the creations of others.
    <br>
    We are doing this through the use of internet archive tools, such as the Wayback Machine, which you can find <a href="web.archive.org">here,</a> as well as random stuff that we made from our computers.
    <br>
    Our site will contain everything from chatrooms to browser versions of Minecraft. Some of our stuff may be glitchy and will not work at times, please be patient.</a>
    <br>
    Thank you for coming along for the ride. We appreciate it.
