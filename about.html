    About Us
  </h1>
  <p>
    Our goal is to try and recreate the early days of the Internet, in order to have some of the experiences that the latest generation may have missed out on.
    <br>
    We are doing this through the use of internet archive tools, such as the Wayback Machine, which you can find <a href="web.archive.org">here.</a>
    <br>
    Our site will contain everything from chatrooms to early versions of Minecraft that were originally hosted on <a href="https://minecraft.net">the Minecraft website.</a>
    <br>
    Thank you for coming along for the ride. We appreciate it.
