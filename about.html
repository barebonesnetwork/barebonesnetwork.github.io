  <p>
    Our goal is to try and recreate the early days of the Internet, in order to have some of the experiences that the latest generation may have missed out on. We are doing this through the use of internet archive tools, such as the Wayback Machine, which you can find <a href="web.archive.org">here.</a>Our site will contain everything from chatrooms to Minecraft 1.5.2.
